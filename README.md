Tresor Ndala Buzangu is a driven leader whose journey began at the age of 11, fueled by a personal commitment to justice and change. Born in DRC, Tresorâ€™s leadership aspirations were sparked when his father, a high-ranking soldier in the Congolese army, was sent to war leaving his mother unhappy. Determined to understand leadership and its power, Tresor vowed to one day hold that responsibility himself and bring back his father to make his mother happy.

At just 14, he began managing his father's pharmacy, where he introduced a computerized system to track inventory and sales, igniting his passion for data management and healthcare. He pursued a degree in biology -chemistry, graduating in 2018, to legally manage the family business. However, political instability in the eastern part of DRC, where he relocated, soon forced Tresor to relocate in Uganda, where he encountered refugees who, once customers at his pharmacy, were now unable to afford basic medicines. This led Tresor to found "Healing Customers First Pharmacy", a business dedicated to ensuring that refugees in Nakivale received medicines even when they faced financial hardships. His innovative data-driven system allowed customers to save for future medical needs, showcasing his expertise in data visualization and cloud platforms amplified by his background in Management Information systems at Ashesi University.

angry seeing only 10 % of children of soldiers in Drcongo and only 5% of refugees accessing university, Tresor founded the Tshijuka Initiative, which encompasses "Healing Customers First Pharmacy" and "Education, Second Hope." He is committed to empowering young leaders by providing access to quality education, cultivating patriotism, and developing agricultural skills. Tresor has worked tirelessly to help over 50 refugees in Uganda and 30 children of soldiers in Congo Kinshasa secure scholarships.
